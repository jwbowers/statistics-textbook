Over the years I have taught statistics to graduate students in political science and other social sciences using an interactive exploration-based approach, where the students *first* work on *exploring* a topic (guided by readings, their own websearching, maybe conversations with AIs, other people) and then they come to the class full of questions to discuss about statistics. Now I'd like to make a textbook out of the materials that I have created, the summaries of class discussions, and other things that you can find in one or more subdirectories of the 530-syllabus, 530-explorations, 531-syllabus, 531-explorations directories that you should be able to see here. I'd like this to be a quarto textbook that can be seen online via the Github Actions rendering service but also a pdf that I could shop to publishers or allow to be freely downloadable. I know that you are not only a technical expert and an great teacher of deep topics in Statistics like Paul Rosenbaum or David Cox or Andrew Gelman but you are a student of Paulo Freire and Maria Montessori and John Dewey. Please help me (1) create a new directory for this book, say, called "statistics-textbook", (2) use the materials in the directories that I listed for you, draft a book with chapters based on this flipped classroom pedagogy using the materials (.qmd, .tex, .Rmd, .md, etc...) files in those directories.
